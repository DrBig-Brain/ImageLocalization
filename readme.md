# Image Localization Practice Repository

This is a personal repository for practicing and implementing image localization techniques using deep learning. The project focuses on understanding and applying object localization concepts using Keras.

## Reference
This implementation is based on the article:
[Object Localization using Keras](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/object-localization-using-keras-d78d6810d0be) by Analytics Vidhya

## Purpose
- Learning and implementing object localization
- Understanding deep learning concepts for computer vision
- Personal practice and experimentation with Keras

Note: This is a learning project and not intended
